## Borys Generalov  ðŸ‘‹

I am a Cloud Architecture Consultant (self employed) with over 16 years of experience in the industry. My expertise lies in designing and implementing cloud-based solutions, using Microsoft Azure or AWS, and Kubernetes.

Prior to my current role, I worked at Microsoft as a Senior Consultant focused on Azure Cloud & AI, where I gained invaluable insights into cloud computing and its impact on the industry. Today, I am actively involved in the open source community, contributing to variety of projects like [MixedReality](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/mixed-reality/develop/javascript/tutorials/babylonjs-webxr-helloworld/introduction-01), [DevOps Dojo](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/devops/author/kantan/) and [Azure Architecture Center](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/).

## My Recent Work

* [Testcontainers for .NET](https://dotnet.testcontainers.org/): I contributed to this project by adding support for [AWS LocalStack](https://github.com/localstack/localstack), allowing developers to easily create integration tests without connecting to remote AWS environment.
* [Azure Architecture Center](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/): I have contributed to this project by creating sample architectures for various scenarios, such as comparing Azure and AWS offering, using Azure Monitor or Azure Service Bus.
* [DRAFT.DEV](https://draft.dev/) I write for DRAFT.DEV about Kubernetes, architecture design, and software development with .NET and NodeJs.
